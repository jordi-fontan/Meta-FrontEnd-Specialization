Social networks are a great tool to share content with
friends and family, and even with coworkers
and business partners. When you share a link, most social networks
generate a preview of the link to let users know what the linked
webpage is about. Now that you're
learning more about front end web development, you're probably wondering how social networks generate
these previews. In this video, you will
learn how Meta tags help webpages create previews
of other web pages. By using Meta tags to control what information is
displayed to users, you can get more clicks when
you share your websites. But the Meta tags web developers
use for this purpose are different from the traditional SEO Meta tags that you learned about earlier
in this lesson. Traditional SEO Meta tags are oriented towards search
results, not direct links. Facebook's rapid growth
led to millions of people sharing thousands
of links every day. To improve the user experience, they had to find a way to
display information about a website before a user
clicks on the link. To address this challenge, Facebook established the
Open Graph Protocol in 2010. The Open Graph
Protocol is a set of Metadata rules that allow web pages to describe
themselves to social networks. There are many Metadata options available within the protocol, but before you learn about them, let's first discuss how the Open Graph Protocol
Metadata is defined. Earlier in this lesson, you learned that Meta
tags are defined inside of the head element
of an HTML document. The Open Graph Protocol also uses Meta tags added
to the head element, but they are slightly different. Instead of the name attribute, the Open Graph Protocol uses the property attribute to
define the Metadata name. Then, like the
regular Meta tags, it uses the content attribute to define the Metadata value. Each property in the Open
Graph Protocol starts with og : as a convention to identify it as an Open Graph
Protocol related tag. The Open Graph Protocol
requires that you must always include four
properties on a webpage. These are title,
type, URL, and image. The title property defines
the title of the page, this is the text that will
appear in the preview. The type property defines
the type of content, such as website, video,
music, or article. Depending on the value
you specify as the type, other properties
may be required. You will learn about
these in a later video. The URL property defines
the permanent web address that the social network must
use for the specific page. The image property
defines a URL to an image that must display
when the website is shared. Together, these Open Graph
Protocol properties enables social media platforms to create a preview of the
shared web link. Say, you share a blog post. The title of the post
is the og:title, the blog post URL is the og:url, and the image that
displays is the og:image. There are several other
optional properties that you will learn
more about later. But let's briefly
explore three of these. The description
property provides a description of the webpage. The locale property
describes the language and territory of the
webpage's content. For example, en_US
specifies that the page is in English and the locale is the United States. The site name property
describes the name of the overall website that
the webpage belongs to. You've now learned how to use Metadata to describe
web pages so that social networks can improve user experience by
previewing shared content. Next time you share a
website on a social network, you can use what
you've learned about Open Graph Protocol properties
to generate more clicks.
