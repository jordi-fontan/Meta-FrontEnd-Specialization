## Intro

- CSS or cascading style sheets is a set of rules that enhance the appearance of web pages. 
- In the early years of the internet browsers adopted CSS because it presented an opportunity for better visual designs and more creativity 
- As browsers continue to develop and grow beyond traditional devices. C. S. S. S capabilities developed in parallel. 
- This development includes the introduction of responsive design in CSS and has further grown from there with layout options such as 
  -   flex boxes, 
  -   grids 
  -   and boxes. 
- And you could argue that layout is one of the most important components of designing a good web page because layouts help divide a page into different sections, thus making the page more presentable. 
 
## So let's learn more about CSS web layouts.

 -  CSS can be used to enhance a web page by modifying fonts, colors, layout, size and other style formatting options that make the web page more presentable. 
 -  ** The browser window that is visible to the user on the screen is called the view ports. **
 -  In essence, the idea behind any CSS web layout is to create an optimally designed web page that has a good view ports at any given point. 
 -  In other words, CSS layouts are all about how the content of your web pages organized when it comes to creating layouts.
 -   Using CSS? 
 
 ##  display property and box model

 -   An important property is the display property. What does it do you ask? The display property specifies the type of box that you want to use for a given html element. 
 -   You might remember from an earlier course that the display property determines if a rendered boxes in line or block box models, allocate rectangles or boxes to html elements.

 -   So CSS rules can be applied, for example, the relative CSS rule for a html element with an I. D. Named sample would contain display property with a block value. The code changes the property of the display box to a block type layouts created using the block type are good .

 ##  flex box and grid, 
 
 

 

 -   but evolving requirements led to the development of CSS web layouts such as flex box and grid, which helped create rules for multiple elements. 
 -   They added more flexibility and dimensionality with better options for fine tuning specific sections of a web page. 
 -   The main difference between the two is that flex box is one dimensional while grid as the word implies is two dimensional.

## Brief Overview

 -     You will examine these in more detail over the course of the module. But for now let's just do a brief overview. 
 -    
 ### Flex
 -      
 -        Flex box is short for flexible box model and it was introduced before the grid layout. 
 -        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63612112/236798703-c0a43a5c-ec35-4ca2-9c0c-ec188c873c64.png)  {width=200 height=200}
 -     For example, the flex box property with an I. D. Named sample contains the display property with flex as its value, flex box adds responsiveness to CSS with float elements and positioning one dimensional refers to the fact that a given flex box container will arrange items in either a column or a row along its axis. 
 -     The flex box container applied over an element can flex to shrink or expand. Thus resulting in a flexible responsive design. 

### Grid

 -     CSS grid is similar to the flex box except it creates a two dimensional grid along both the row and column axes. 
 -     For example, the grid rules for the sample I. D.

 -     Can be added after adding the display property with the grid as its value while the grid increases dimensionality and helps to create an advanced layout with relative ease.
 -   It can also lead to increased complications later. 
 -   If the element rules are not systematically defined, there is no strict rule on choosing which layout to use
 -   in general flex boxes are more suitable when you want to create flexible elements in smaller spaces while grids are more suitable to large scale layouts.

-   A separate explanation of each type of layout has been given in this video, 
-   but in practice, you'll likely encounter the use of more than one layout in rendering a single page. 
 -     The rules for these layouts and CSS are standardized but that doesn't mean you are limited when it comes to creativity, aesthetics or optimization.
 -    When designing a web page, you will learn more about how to use these layouts during the course
